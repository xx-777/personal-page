        <section>
            <p>I am a Bachelor of Art Student majored in drama and writing. I have always been interesting in web design and programming, 
                especially the design of UI and UX for a digital product, for it has a lot of similarity with storytelling: 
                both try to build up the immersive experience for the user based on their reality but goes beyond. </p>
        </section>   

        
        <h2 class="sub-header" id="a">A - Personal Poster</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> 
                The goal of this assignment is to design a poster that communicate our ideas to the audience through visual aids such as low fidelity sketches and images. 
                We should think of a concept that visualises the chosen datasets in an interesting and interactive way.
            </p>
            <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    Inspired by the Digital Pet and Travel frog, I came up intriguing way to present the botanic dataset from Brisbane City Council.

                    The users can have a koala as a digital pet who will travel from time to time, and when it comes back, it will bring the user a leave of the local plant from where it travelled. 
                    The leave would appear as unknown until the user click to identify it.

                    After being identified, the leaf will show the name and photo of the plant from which the leave being collected, 
                    and the geometric feature and the probable habitat of this plant. Then, the leaf will be collected into the album, as a souvenir. 
                </p>

                <section class="image"><img src="images/personal poster.png" width="550" height="300"></section>

                <p> 
                    My design's goal is to craft a digital experience that delivers emotional value to users by merging the pursuit of knowledge with the joy of interacting with a digital pet. It reveals to users  the whimsical travel adventures of a digital friend through the  sunounir she brings back.
                    There are three core features that engage users with Travel Koala:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interactive Companionship: Users can directly interact with their digital pet, the Koala. Simple actions, such as clicking on the Koala, elicit charming responses like ear shakes. The Koala also sends daily greetings to users.</li>
                        <li>Educational Exploration: The application uses datasets to impart knowledge, allowing users to learn new and interesting facts seamlessly as they engage with their Travel Koala.</li>
                        <li>The Joy of Collection: Users can indulge in the delight of collecting various digital souvenirs the Koala brings back, enhancing the sense of achievement and nostalgia.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>

            <p> 
                I gained a rough knowledge about the datasets and its visualisation preparing this task. However, 
                I should have done more research for my idea. 
                For example, my concept is inspired by digital pet and travel frog. 
                I could have investigated the ui/ux design and analyse what strategies those proved-successful products used to attracts their targeted audience. 
                Like how any other creative process, I conceive my idea based on the existed successful products. 
                Analysing what made these products successful or popular can help completing and materialising my idea, 
                for it would be supported by the calculative decision-making process instead of the intuitive spark.

        <h2 class="sub-header" id="b">B - Forming Team</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    In this section, we were supposed to form teams according to our interested concept, 
                    and settle on a concept either by picking a member's or brainstorming a new one.  
                </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    In our team, three out of four members had no prior experience with coding, 
                    which made it challenging for us to choose or combine concepts, 
                    as each of us had a different idea that we had invested a lot of effort into, but didn't know technic of making it.
                    Looking back now, I should have put aside my personal inclination to push for my concept and appreciate the ideas of others, 
                    for each idea and dataset has its unique trait that can be explored on multiple levels. 
                    I could have analyzed each idea's potential to see if they could be woven together to form a more captivating and cohesive concept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I learned that without understanding and appreciating others' opinions first, 
                    expressing concerns by highlighting the weaknesses in someone else's design can come across as an attack, 
                    which would hinder the conversation. 
                    It is important to express one's concerns in a neutral and polite manner, with evidence and possible solution.
                </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header" id="c">C - Team Proposal </h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>At this stage we were trying to explore all the posibilities for our product, by drawing the user persona,
                    user senario and storyboard.
                </p>
            
            <h3>My Task</h3>
                <p>
                    I aimed for user engagement with the product to be effortless.
                    Believing that the most appealing aspect for users would be storytelling through the product, 
                    I create a storyboard that intertwines the basic user behavior with the narrative structure of our product. 
                    This ensures that even users who engage at the most basic level actively contribute to our story world, 
                    inspiring others to interact with the fountain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the context of the water fountain, the core behavior is the user physically approaching and using it. 
                    Inspired by a tutor's suggestion about 'conquering' the fountain, 
                    I designed a narrative driven by this action. 
                    Users can take ownership of the fountain and become a fountain maintainer or a 'praetor'—a term inspired by an image of a Roman fountain. 
                    A fountain praetor can alter the fountain's appearance and the information displayed, 
                    and also receive a greeting message each time their fountain is used.
                </p>

                <div class="image"><img src="images/storyboard.png" width="450px"></div>


                <p>
                    For users with low intention to engage with the game part of our website, 
                    their behaviour of merely approaching the fountain would initiate a greeting being sent to the foutain's praetor.
                    This makes them, though engaging in the most basic level, an essential part of the narrative 
                    that motivates other users to interact with our product.
                
                </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                we should have narrowed down the target user sooner, because it could have saved us a lot of time of arguing about the style and function.
                We initially choosed people of all age as the target user because we assumed every one can be benefit from our product which promote refill water instead 
                of buying plastic bottle. However, the broad range of users made it hard to make design decisions. If we couldn't picture a specific group of person then we 
                couldn't justify the design decision-making.

        <h2 class="sub-header" id="d" >D - MVP</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    At the beginning this stage, we were asked to define the main function of our product in one sentence. This helped a lot because that according to Giesen and Osborne (2008,) our team were still at the storming stage where we hadn't reach an agreement on the functionality our product.
                    with this request we quickly defined the core function --the map, and started to make coding plan for the upcoming presentation.
                </p>

            <h3>My Task</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the feedback we received indicating that our story board and low-fidelity prototype were going toward different directions, 
                    the priority was to unit our vision for our product for the MVP presentation. 
                    However, me and the other designer had very different approach to the game part, and we ended up built two prototypes.
                    After considering the feedback from the presentation, I included features that enhance user engagement. 
                    I modified the conditions for claiming a fountain: now, when a user checks in at a fountain, they have a chance to obtain a bottle of water. 
                    This bottle is the essential item needed to transfer ownership of a fountain. 
                    With this change, the more game-engaged users are motivated to interact others, 
                    for the later can gift out their water, thus promoting community and participation with minimal effort.

                    My design wasn’t chosen comparing to another prototype made by my teammate. 
                    We decided to use hers after evaluating and analysing the two-prototype based on other team members’ research result, 
                    which showed our targeted audience, 15- to 25-year-old-bikers, were more likely to be drawn into games involving racing and competing. 
                    Moreover, my prototype failed to provide a more detailed and aesthetically consistent blueprint 
                    which should not only show the functionality but also the supposing style for the future product. 
                    Once the prototype was decided. 
                    I started to learn how to code website and wrote the HTML and CSS of the home page for the MVP presentation.

                    I gained a rough understanding about the requirement of the interaction plan in the workshop.
                    But during our discussion I didn’t check if other team members knew the 
                    same information. Moreover I was not confident enough to change the finished 
                    interaction plan for I didn't believe I have enough experience or knowledge to annotate its data structure.
                    This led to an unnecessary loss of mark on our MVP presentation. 
                    From this case I learnt the importance of team communicating.Other members in the team might not know what 
                    I knew and vice versa. In teamworking, we should constantly check and confirm that 
                    we are on the same page about any information or criteria that could 
                    influence the final product.  More importantly, it is crucial to create a environment 
                    for everyone in the team to feel confident to express their dounbts and concerns.

                    The process of user interaction is not as simple as I thought. For example, when we articulate the user-interacting flow, we say "After the user has arrived at this place, they could choose to start a new challenge ". And in the flow chart, this process can be represented by a mere two boxes: "user arrives" and "start challenge".
                    But in real user testing,  there are so many incidents included in these two boxes,  and each requires a specific UI design decision to be made.
                    How to evaluate if the user is near the fountain?
                    After the user arrives, should they click the fountain to continue the next interaction or should the pop-up show immediately? How to mark the closure of a specific task without being burdensome?
                    In the case of quitting, the user might want to quit the challenge at the very beginning, right after she learns the rules. Or,  she might want to quit in the middle of the challenge. we need to design different responses for our app to apply in different situations, and this needs a lot of user testing.

                I also partially wrote the JavaScript for toggling the colour of selected marker, which not only deepened my understanding of JavaScript, but also the design of user interaction. My original thought was that when the user clicks a marker, the selected marker will change to red to differ from the rest. This is easy to achieve by adding an event listener.  The tricky part is to decide when will the marker become un-selected. 
                I listed several conditions where the marker should become un-selected. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    When the user clicks on another marker, the older marker automatically being unselected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Once the user arrives to the fountain, once user’s circle touches the fountain marker, the marker automatically become unselected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    When the User clicks on the marker, it will check if “is nearby”, and if “marker being selected”, 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    When user clicked one marker and clicked “show route”, but she/he wants to give up before finishing the route. (no method once the user was in the navigating route, user will have to finish the route to unselect the marker, or refresh the website)
                    </li>

                    In the process of launching our final product, I deepened my understanding about the design iteration. The real situation is always more complicated than what we designed. And the more tests we had done, the more situations our product could cover, and it improved the function flow and thus created a better experience for the user.
                    instead of interacting with users exclusively through the user task flow or the narrative, a digital product could provide various ways of interaction, and each create unique aesthetic value.  This can stem from little interactions such as the effect from clicking a button, a short animation while loading, an interesting icon, etc.

        <h2 class="sub-header" id="reflection"> Course  Summary</h2>
        <section>

                <p>
                    At the beginning of this course, I knew nothing about coding or web design. 
                    I wrote down only two lines in the first week’s portfolio: 
                    “I need to learn what is dataset.” and “I need to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.” 
                    because other than these I have no idea what I will encounter. 
                </p>
                
                <p>Throughout the semester, 
                    I've gained a solid experience of launching a digital product—from the early stages of creative conceptualization, 
                    through multiple design iterations, to the culminating presentation. 
                    I've learnt how to plan and document long-term project.
                    I've recognized the critical role of research and user testing in design decision-making. 
                    Moreoever, I've learnt how to work and communicate in a team, 
                    particularly when there are different viewpoints. 
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    After this very productive semester, I have gained more than what I expected. Thanks for my capable teammates, patient tutors and everyone I met in this course, 
                    I have had a great time.
